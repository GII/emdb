#  Welcome to the e-MDB's documentation!

Here it is available the documentation of the first software version of the e-MDB cognitive architecture, an outcome of Work Package 5 (WP5), within the PILLAR Robots project.รง

*This documentation is currently being updated. New sections and content will be added soon.*

## e-MDB repositories
The architecture, at this moment, is divided into five GitHub repositories, which documentation is available in the following links. In all of them, is included a description of their content and their behavior in the structure of the architecture.

- [e-MDB core components](https://docs.pillar-robots.eu/projects/emdb_core/) - Core of the cognitive architecture.
- [Cognitive nodes implemented by the GII](https://docs.pillar-robots.eu/projects/emdb_cognitive_nodes_gii/) - Reference implementation for the main cognitive nodes.
- [Cognitive processes implemented by the GII](https://docs.pillar-robots.eu/projects/emdb_cognitive_processes_gii/) - Reference implementation for the main cognitive processes.
- [Discrete event simulator to be used in experiments](https://docs.pillar-robots.eu/projects/emdb_discrete_event_simulator_gii/) - Implementation of discrete event simulators used in many experiments.
- [Experiments designed by the GII](https://docs.pillar-robots.eu/projects/emdb_experiments_gii/) - Configuration of the implemented experiments to test the cognitive architecture.

## How to do
We included several short guides to help our partners in the first steps to add their own implementations into the architecture:

- [How to install the e-MDB cognitive architecture software](how_to_do/how_to_install.md)
- [How to work with Cognitive Nodes](how_to_do/work_with_cognitive_nodes.md)
- [How to work with Motivations](how_to_do/work_with_goals.md)
- [How to work with Perceptions](how_to_do/work_with_perceptions.md)
- [How to configure an experiment](how_to_do/yaml_launch_files.md)
