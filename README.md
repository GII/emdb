# e-MDB meta repository

This is the meta repository that includes all the packages needed for correct and complete operation of the e-MDB cognitive architecture software.

The architecture, at this moment, is divided into five GitHub repositories:

- [e-MDB core components](https://github.com/pillar-robots/emdb_core) - Core of the cognitive architecture.
- [Cognitive nodes implemented by the GII](https://github.com/pillar-robots/emdb_cognitive_nodes_gii) - Reference implementation for the main cognitive nodes.
- [Cognitive processes implemented by the GII](https://github.com/pillar-robots/emdb_cognitive_processes_gii) - Reference implementation for the main cognitive processes.
- [Discrete event simulator to be used in experiments](https://github.com/pillar-robots/emdb_discrete_event_simulator_gii) - Implementation of discrete event simulators used in experiments.
- [Experiments designed by the GII](https://github.com/pillar-robots/emdb_experiments_gii) - Configuration files for experiments.

You can find information and tutorials about the e-MDB cognitive architecture software in the [PILLAR Robots official documentation](https://docs.pillar-robots.eu/en/latest/)
